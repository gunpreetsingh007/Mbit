	Mbit is an inventory management system for restaurant owners, along with data analytics designed in Angular.
  
	Customers can place their orders directly without the need of manually asking the waiter by scanning the Qr code placed in their dining table, which will show them inventory of that restaurant in a webpage. They can manually pick an item and place order.
  
	By doing so, we took this placing order step online and gave full analytics of the day to the restaurant owner like total no. of food items sold today, max selling food item etc.
